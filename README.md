# notes for English-speaking users

* I just grepped the openssl calls out of the php file and made a bash script
* the .pfx file is to import into gpgsm for signing. could also name as .p12
* If the password you gave SAT doesn't work, maybe they upcased or swapcased it
  (they swapcased mine; either that or the caps lock was on when I typed it,
   and I wasnÂ´t allowed to see what I was typing)
* typing `make` will do all that the php script does
* the results will be found in the directory where the original files from
  SAT were stored, e.g. /mnt/usb/FIEL_ABCD950505XY9_20250225093522/
* for use with PGP: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/62613267/493161>
* parent certs for potential use with pgpsm signing can be found at 
  <http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/certificado_sello_digital.htm> and
  <https://www.cloudb.sat.gob.mx/TSP_MX.pdf>; these are now imported into gpgsm
  by default.
* using detached signatures after finding that nothing can read signed txt
  files, and though browsers can mostly view signed PDFs they aren't able to
  detect nor verify the signatures.
* [build complete chain in pfx/p12 file](https://serverfault.com/a/1011396/58945) (had to run `openssl rehash -compat .` inside sat.certs directory first).
* for use with Firefox and LibreOffice, first set up a separate profile
  (I called mine SAT) by starting firefox with the -ProfileManager option.
* in firefox, click "hamburger" icon at upper right for settings, then
  Privacy & Security | Certificates | View Certificates | Your Certificates | Import
  Locate the pfx file and import it; you will see it imports your key under
  Your Certificates, and *also* imports the SAT cert, and the self-signed
  Banco de Mexico root certificate, under Authorities.
  Click the OK button in Certificate Manager to close it.
* in loffice, select Tools | Options | LibreOffice | Security | Certificate,
  and choose the firefox:SAT profile you just made. Then, from
  File | Digital Signatures | Digital Signatures, you can sign a PDF document.
  It will warn that the signature could not be verified.
